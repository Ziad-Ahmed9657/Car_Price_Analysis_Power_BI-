# Car_Price_Analysis_Power_BI_Python
Hi, I`m very excited to share my first project as a data analyst. is a Car price Dashboard, I used Python, Power BI to generate it , it was my task from Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI to make preprocessing to data but I learned Power BI as a self study and made a Data Anaylsis by it

## Project Workflow:



✅ Data Cleaning: make sure that Data not has missing values, duplication, outliers, handle feature names , and change feature`s data type if needed. all these steps made by Python



✅ Power Query: after load data in Power BI must to ensure that all columns have suitable data type and make first row as a column header if data not have a header.



Note: I could make all preprocessing in Power BI but I did it with python so don`t need to repeat all previous steps again



✅ DAX Measure: Create measure query to assist me during create interactive dashboard



✅ Power BI Dashboard: Build interactive dashboard to help decision-maker to take the best decision


## What I learned:


1️⃣ How to make preprocessing with Python



2️⃣ How to write DAX Measure to exploit with best use



3️⃣ How to make Interactive Dashboard by create a Filter data
